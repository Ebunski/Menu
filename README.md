### Built with

- React javascript
- CSS custom properties and dynamically rendered css classes
- Flexbox and grid

## My process

- I went through the mobile and desktop styles on the css files
- Created the layout of the components
- Gave the page life with the magic of javascript.

### What I learnt

1. React:

   - new Set(arr) - returns object of unique values (so you have to ...spread it)

2. Css

- styling buttons - transparent
- add image styles in the img tag not the container.

  Overall it was a very wonderful project.
